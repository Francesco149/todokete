temporary front-end prototype. will rewrite as native code later, I just
needed something quick and dirty

i've never used react or done modern web dev before, don't pay too much
attention to the code

please do NOT run this on an untrusted network. this is not meant to be
secure.

# usage

```sh
npm i
npm start
```

this connects to the backend on port 6868 and should be hosted on the same
ip
